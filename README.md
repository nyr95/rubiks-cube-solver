Rubik's Cube Solver
This project is a simple, functional Rubik’s Cube Solver built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It demonstrates object-oriented cube modeling, move logic, cube scrambling, and a basic 6-step solving algorithm.

Features
- Object-oriented cube representation
- Manual face rotation logic (CW and CCW)
- Scramble functionality
- Solve button performing 6-step solution:
  1. Solve white cross
  2. Solve white corners
  3. Solve middle layer edges
  4. Solve yellow cross
  5. Solve yellow corners
  6. Final layer edge/corner orientation
- Visual display of cube after each move using getCubeSvg()

How to Use
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Use the interface to reset, scramble, or solve the cube.
